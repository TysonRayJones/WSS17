Hi,
my name's on the screen


My original project was to use neural networks to make predictions of quantum physics behaviour,	 
>>    specifically the forms of the lowest lying eigenstates



It turns out this is a rather uninteresting problem for a neural net.

So join me in a minute and a half of mournful silence for my project

In working on that, I found myself needing to plot or simulate a bunch of wavefunctions
in different representations; lists of numbers, symbolic expressions and pure or interpolating functions.
The code was different and ad hoc, but the underlying states were the same;  
here's a potential, here's my wavefunction, evolve it for 4s.

I realised this as a barrier to using Mathematica for students to experiment with quantum physics, computationally

So I made a bunch of packages
