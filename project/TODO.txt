TODO

- extend PlotWavefunction to take specifying coords and values independently, 1D and 2D, using 'Interpolation'
>>> see if other methods which assumed uniform passed grids can be updated to relax that assumption

- make GetEigenmodes output grid in matrix format

- make PlotSpectrum accept grid/wavefunc in the newly added PlotWavefunction formats

- add 'PlotAsProbDensity -> False' option, overriden for complex wavefuncs
  (to PlotSpectrum)

- move symbolicQ to PlotFunctions to remove those dodgy cases where PlotWavefunction matches lists/matrices wavefunctions/potentials when a domain is passed (causing plotting of multiple functions, often unexpectedly)



- apply Wolfram Certified instructor
- speak to Travis
- contact Arun? **
